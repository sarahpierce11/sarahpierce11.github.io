            <p class="text-justified bg-light"> Bootstrap is a front-end framework that was developed to 
              support web developers in the creation of websites and web applications. Bootstrap aids web
              developers as it is easy and fast processing. Bootstrap supports all major broswers. This 
              application was first launched as a mobile-first framework. As bootstrap was used by more and more 
              web developers it quickly became the most popular in the web design industry. This was due to 
              its unique and powerful features that allowed fully responsive and functioning features 
              while slashing most hassels of code. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based templates for typography,
              forms, buttons, tables, navigation and much more. This application also allows for JavaScript
              pluggins. Bootstraps responsive CSS adjusts to all screen types. By using bootstrap you will increase
              your productivity time.

              <div class="card-body">
                <div class="card-title">Bootstrap Basics</div>
                  <p class="card-text">In typical code you see both an HTML and CSS file. With bootstrap you are able to
                  use just an HTML file and program the CSS styles within. This done by linking boostrap as a stylesheet
                  in the head of your code. This style sheet allows for preset styles to be applied in yur HTML by using 
                  various class tags. This will not add limitations to the design of your website as you can utalize this to
                  your desire.  
                </p>

            <div>
              <p class="text-justified bg-light">Bootstrap has ten automative colours built into its system. This allows developers 
                to use meaning through colour. As the name of the colours are corrisponding for what the colour is intended for. These
                colours can also be used on links, which will add a darker colour when hovered on. Below is an example list
                of the ten colours. 
              </p>
            
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item bg-primary text-center">.bg-primary</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-secondary text-center">.bg-secondary</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-success text-center">.bg-success</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-danger text-center">.bg-danger</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-warning text-center">.bg-warning</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-info text-center">.bg-info</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-light text-center">.bg-light</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-center">.bg-dark</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-white text-center">.bg-white</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-center">.bg-transparent</li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>

            <p class="text-justified bg-light">Bootsrap uses a flexbox grid to allow developers to build grids in any layout. 
              Bootstrap uses a twelve column system with five responsive tiers. This works by using a series of containers,
              rows, and colums to align content. grid columns that do not have a specific width will automatically lay out as equal columns 
              by using breaking points. Below is an example of how this can be applied.
            </p>
            
            <div class="container">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8 bg-info">.col-md-8</div>
                <div class="col-6 col-md-4 bg-primary"> .col-6 .col-md-4</div>
              </div>
                
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-6 col-md-4 bg-secondary"> .col-6 .col-md-4</div>
                  <div class="col-6 col-md-4 bg-warning">.col-6  .col-md-4</div>
                  <div class="col-6 col-md-4 bg-info">.col-6 .col-md-4</div>
                </div>

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-6 bg-danger">.col-6</div>
                  <div class="col-6 bg-primary">.col-6</div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card">

              <p class="text-justified bg-light">Cards are important in a webpage as they are used to promote
                information in a website. Cards support many content items. Bootstrap includes ways to stylaize
                and customize cards to the content that the card will be holding. Examples of  this will be seen above.
              </p>
              
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" style="width: 30%;"> Button</button>
                <p class="text-justified bg-light">Bootstrap uses several styles of buttons for different purposes. 
                  Bootstrap does allow some extra classes to further cusomization. Extra classes to further customization
                can include button tags, outline buttons, sizes, active state and much more. An example of a buttton being applied
              can be seen above. The button above has a hover feature, allowing the background colour to darken when hovered over. </p>

            <p>As reliable forms are important for web development, Bootstrap includes classes to utalize the use of forms. 
              These forms can be completely customizable with the type of content it will recive, styles of the form,sizing of
            the form, and able to add the ability to range inputs. Below is an example of an email form being created using Bootstrap. </p>
            
            <div class="form-group has-warning has-feedback" style="width: 55%">
              <label class="control-label" for="inputWarning"></label>

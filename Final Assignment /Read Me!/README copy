In my final project, I constructed the model of a website I made in my UXD class. 
I created a project slightly different then my peers. As the project began my 
porfesor agreed to let me design my website for a company myself and i freind of 
mine created. We crteaed Fox Den Apparel to begin putting our udeas into products,
such as majoirty of our products are apparel. 
During this project I learned how truely hard it can be to want to take a website 
to the next level. In creating this website it took many design options and back 
and forth between several ideas. This was becuase I wanted to make sure I created 
a branding that felt authenic to us. 
Durnig the process of coding this website, i really learned how difficult it can be
to have inspiration, an outline, and a wireframe and still be unable to create exactly 
what you had in mind. Ive learned how accept changes through projects and how to embrasse
them as it can be more bennefical to make a less extravigant design, then a broken website. 
I really enjoyed the opurtunity to use this project in a way that applies to my real life.
It was interesting and intruging to see how we would continue to develop our company in the furture 
if we wish to do so.
